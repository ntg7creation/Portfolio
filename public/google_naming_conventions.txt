1. Functions
- Naming Convention: camelCase
- Example: calculateTotal, getUserData
- Description: Function names should be written in camelCase, starting with a lowercase letter and capitalizing the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word.

2. Classes
- Naming Convention: PascalCase
- Example: UserAccount, DataProcessor
- Description: Class names should be written in PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase), where the first letter of each word is capitalized.

3. Files
- Naming Convention: snake_case
- Example: user_data_handler.py, data_processor.cpp
- Description: File names should use snake_case, which consists of lowercase words separated by underscores.

Additional Naming Guidelines
- Constants: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, e.g., MAX_CONNECTIONS, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT.
- Variables: Use camelCase similar to functions, e.g., userName, currentIndex.
